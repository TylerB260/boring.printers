TylerB's Money Printers (v1)
==============

These were my first attempt at making custom printers.

When I started the project, I had no intention of adding more printers or resources (paper, ink, fans, etc) to the printers.

For all intents and purposes, this project is complete.

DarkRP Integration
==============

These printers should add themselves to the F4 menu in 2.5.0+

If they don't, for some reason, the DarkRP.createEntity() code is contained in [lua/autorun/tylerb_printers.lua](https://github.com/TylerBundy/money_printers/blob/master/lua/darkrp_customthings/tylerb_printers.lua).
